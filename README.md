# Denoising practice

My custom repository for multiple Denoising task.

- inlcude supervised training
- include self-supervised training
- include generation-base training

- include various dataset
    - SIDD
    - DND

## How to use

## Add custom code

### development schedule (inverse time line)

- basic modules for deep-learning.
    - [ ] Add summary printing module
    - [ ] Save configuration file and network code
    - [ ] Add tensor board output
    - [ ] Add code for printing something important while training
    - [ ] Add binary data conversion
    - [ ] Shape progress module function like tqdm
    - [ ] Add progress bar in progress module
    - [ ] Add cfg change with argument
    - [ ] add 0.5 at saving image time and also in clipping time
    - [x] Add test code
    - [x] Use "start_epoch" and "interval_epoch"
    - [x] Add validation image out
    - [x] Add training process for self-supervised manner
