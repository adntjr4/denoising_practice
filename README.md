### development schedule (inverse time line)

- Generative noise model training.
    - [ ] revise codes for GAN (e.g. loss, trainer, config, etc)
    - [ ] C2N reproduction
    
- basic modules for deep-learning.
    - [ ] Add test code
    - [ ] Add summary printing module
    - [ ] Add tensor board output
    - [x] Use "start_epoch" and "interval_epoch"
    - [x] Add validation image out
    - [x] Add training process for self-supervised manner
